# Project Euler Heteroglot

I'm solving the Project Euler problems with a different language for each
problem. Once a language is used, it's off the table for later problems.

The most challenging bit is probably going to be getting each language's
toolchain working enough to run/compile one program.

This idea is shamefully stolen from [eevee][eevee].

# Executing a solution

I'm definitely going to forget how to run/compile these languages. So
`make` should be set up to execute each solution:

    $ cd 001_javascript
    $ make
    node 001.js
    The total is: 233168
    $
