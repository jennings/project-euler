# Project Euler Heteroglot

I'm solving the Project Euler problems with a different language for each
problem. Once a language is used, it's off the table for later problems.

The challenge is getting a language's toolchain working enough to run/compile
one program.

This idea is shamefully stolen from [eevee][eevee].
