      * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
      *
      *   1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
      *
      * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
      *
      *   (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
      *
      * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
      * first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
      *
      *   3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
      *
      * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
      * one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
